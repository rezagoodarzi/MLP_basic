In the context of training a neural network, an "epoch" refers to one complete pass through the entire training dataset. During each epoch, the neural network's parameters (weights and biases) are updated based on the error or loss calculated on the training data. The goal of training is to reduce the error and improve the model's performance.

Here's a breakdown of how training typically occurs over epochs:

1. Forward Pass

- The training dataset is fed forward through the neural network, and predictions are made for each input.

2. Loss Calculation

- The difference between the predicted output and the actual target (ground truth) is calculated using a loss or cost function. This loss represents how well or poorly the model is performing on the training data.

3. Backward Pass

- The gradient of the loss with respect to the model's parameters is calculated. This gradient is used to update the weights and biases of the neural network in the opposite direction of the gradient, aiming to minimize the loss.

4. Parameter Update

- The weights and biases are updated based on the calculated gradients, using an optimization algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or its variants.

5. Repeat

- Steps 1-4 are repeated for each batch of training data until the entire training dataset has been processed. This completes one epoch.
